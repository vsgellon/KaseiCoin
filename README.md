# KaseiCoin
To build a fungible token KaseiCoin that is ERC-20 compliant. This project will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.


The steps for this project are divided into the following sections:

1. Create the KaseiCoin token contract
2. Create the KaseiCoin crowdsale contract
3. Create the KaseiCoin deployer contract
4. Perform a real-world, pre-production test of your crowdsale. In order to do so, we will deploy the crowdsale to a local blockchain by using Remix, MetaMask, and Ganache

## Technologies

We will use [Remix IDE website](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js) to build and test smart contracts. We will also need to install [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) in order to deploy this project.
